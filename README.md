# Nmap-port-scan-
Nmap Network Reconnaissance Report This project contains an Nmap scan report for the local network range 172.26.176.0/20. The scan was performed using both TCP SYN scan and full-port scan to identify active hosts and their open ports.

ðŸ“‹ Steps Followed
Installed Nmap from the official website.

Determined local IP range: 172.26.176.0/20.

Ran TCP SYN scan:

sudo nmap -sS 172.26.176.0/20

Performed full-port scan:
sudo nmap -p- -sS 172.26.176.0/20

Identified hosts and open ports.

Documented results in HTML report.

Provided recommendations for potential security improvements.

Findings
Host 1: 172.26.176.1 (Microsoft Hyper-V/Windows system)

Open TCP ports: 5754, 6850, 7680, 9012, 9013, 53540-53545

Host 2: 172.26.183.233 (Kali Linux)

No open TCP ports detected.

ðŸš¨ Potential Risks
Unknown custom services on high ports may expose management/debug interfaces.

Port 7680 linked to Windows Delivery Optimization could be misused for P2P file distribution.

Multiple filtered ports suggest firewall presence, but exposed services still increase attack surface


Summary:-

I scanned my local network 172.26.176.0/20 and found 2 active hosts.
My Kali machine has no open TCP ports, but the other host (172.26.176.1) has multiple open ports, including 5754, 6850, 7680, 9012, 9013, and 53540â€“53545.
Some ports are unknown/custom, and 7680 is linked to Windows Delivery Optimization.
These could pose risks if misconfigured or unprotected.
